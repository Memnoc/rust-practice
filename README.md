# A simple series of exercises and practices following various online and offline resources.

The purpose of this repository is practicing Rust and learning about its fundamentals concepts.

I will be mainly following the book titles The Rust Programming Language - some of the implementation on this repository come from that book, that I am finding extremely helpful and enjoyable.

The other main source of inspiration is the Primeagen, a Netlfix Engineer and Youtuber fluent in Rust, that talks about the benefits of this programming language extensively, or at least enough to make me want to start learning it.

As for my personal reasons: as web developer, it's important to stay up to date with the lates and greates technologies out there, the way they evolve and mutate, changin the paradigms in which we operate in this industry.
However, I feel it's of the same, if not greater, importance to learn the ways of other languages, low-level ones, that have the power to teach you concepts that high level languages purposely hide under a sugar-coating of awesomness and magic.
